### Todo
* receive input from console app
* write a few more output tests

### What I don't like (so far)
* throwing too many exceptions in the rover controller
* information passing from and to the rover controller needs improvement

### Suggestions for improvements
* could use a command bus to move both rovers concurrently and avoid colisions
* use a terrain class to model the terrain
